# Image Shredder

Saw this on reddit one day. https://i.imgur.com/w59YRy5.gifv
Thought it be fun to write a program that would perform the same thing for any image.


TODO:
- Implement command line so I don't have to recompile to switch the args up.
- Add ability to cut image into strips and append like in the end state of the gif.
